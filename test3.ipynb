But the protracted stoppage will not affect \\nthe company’s customer deliveries, for which China is its major market.\\nThe company found during the routine maintenance a part of  \\nthe recovery boiler at the site needed to be repaired, thus extending  \\nthe shut, Metsä Fibre said.\\nA company spokesman said that the facility, which has \\na capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per year of bleached and \\nunbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulp, has maintained \\na higher-than-average level of stocks and thus ensured \\ncustomer deliveries were executed in a timely fashion.\\nHe added that Metsä Fibre would maintain the same inventory strategy \\nbecause the Kemi mill would be shut for two months in June-July 2025 \\nto install new evaporators to replace the one damaged in an explosion \\non March 21, which resulted in a shutdown that lasted for three months.Metsä Fibre extends downtime at Kemi plant in \\nFinland to four weeks, not affecting pulp deliveriesSolid demand from China-affiliated recycled pulp and \\npaperboard plants in Southeast Asia have prompted suppliers \\nto push for price rises for imports of old corrugated containers \\n(OCC) in the region, apparently reversing the price decline \\nthat had lasted for several months until mid-November.\\nIn the two weeks to Thursday November 28, vendors inflated offer \\nprices for OCC imports from the US by $10 per tonne and by $5 per \\ntonne for brown grades from Europe in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\\nThe rises took offer levels for US double-sorted OCC (DS \\nOCC 12) to $180-185 per tonne, to China-based buyers \\nand customers in Indonesia and Malaysia, and to $175-\\n180 per tonne in Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan.\\nEuropean OCC 98/2 was offered at $145-150 per tonne  \\nin Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan, and $5 per tonne higher  \\nin Indonesia and Malaysia.\\nDID YOU KNOW...\\n...Regular copying or other redistribution of \\nthis publication —in whole or in part—violates \\nU.S. copyright law and is punishable by fines \\nplus attorney’s fees.

The loader will \\n“enhance Tasmania’s forest \\nexporting capabilities” while \\nstrengthening the state’s \\neconomy, a press release said.\\nThe existing equipment to be \\nreplaced is 32 years old, while \\nthe new ship loader will have \\nmore advanced automation, \\ngreater capacity and better \\nbiosecurity measures in place.\\n“This investment… will ensure \\nfaster, more efficient loading \\nof larger vessels… and provide \\nbenefits such as enhanced \\nsafety features, energy \\nefficiencies and cyber security \\nadvancements,” Tasmania’s \\nMinister for Infrastructure, \\nKerry Vincent, said.\\nThe new ship loader will also \\nhave an automatic chip \\nsampler to ease the current \\nworkflow, which involves manual \\nsampling. The automated \\nsampling process was expected \\nto enable quicker and more \\naccurate wood chip analysis.\\nWood chips will also be \\nable to efficiently undergo \\nfumigation during loading, \\nwhich will save time.\\nTasmania’s forestry sector is \\nworth $1.2 billion per year, and \\nthe government is keen to ensure \\nthat the Port of Bell Bay retains \\nits position as an exports hub.\\nGovernment tenders for \\nconstructing the new loader \\nwill go out next year, with \\nthe new ship loader expected \\nto be installed by 2026.Japanese producer Marubeni \\nannounces change of \\nchairman, president and CEO\\nMarubeni has appointed Masumi \\nKakinoki as its new chairman \\nof the board, effective on April \\n1, 2025 following a meeting \\nof the board of directors on \\nWednesday November 27, the \\ncompany said in a statement.\\nMasumi is Marubeni’s current \\npresident and chief executive \\noffice, and a member of the \\nboard. He joined Marubeni \\nin 1980 before taking on the \\nrole of president and CEO \\nfive years ago in 2019.\\nThe new president and \\nCEO of Marubeni will be \\nMasayuki Omoto, who is \\ncurrently its managing \\nexecutive director. Masayuki \\njoined Marubeni in 1992.\\nExisting chairman of the \\nboard Fumiya Kokubu will \\nstep down from his role \\nto become a member of \\nthe board and honorary \\ncorporate advisor on April 1.\\nIn the statement, Marubeni \\nadded that Fumiya will then \\nresign as member of the board \\nat the general meeting of \\nshareholders, which has been \\nscheduled for June next year.\\nIn its latest integrated report, \\nMarubeni stated that it was \\n“committed to enhancing \\nmedium- to long-term \\ncorporate value by focusing \\nefforts on sustaining and \\nimproving cash generation and \\nreturn on equity (ROE), and \\nreducing the cost of equity.”\\nMarubeni was able to achieve \\nan adjusted net profit in \\nexcess of 450 billion yen \\n($2.93 billion) for a third \\nconsecutive year in the fiscal \\nyear that ended on March 31.According to Fastmarkets \\ndata, Marubeni has paper mills \\nin Japan and Vietnam, and \\npulp facilities in Indonesia. It \\nhas a total capacity of more \\nthan 1.7 million tonnes per \\nyear of pulp and paper.\\nMarubeni and Osaka Gas \\nsign MOU to evaluate the \\nquality of carbon credits\\nA memorandum of \\nunderstanding (MOU) \\nhas been inked between \\nMarubeni Corporation’s \\nPresident and CEO Masumi \\nKakinoki and Osaka Gas Co.’s \\nPresident and CEO Masataka \\nFujiwara for a business \\ncollaboration to establish \\na framework for evaluating \\ncarbon credit quality.\\nCarbon credits are also \\nknown as carbon offsets, \\nwhich are used to reduce, \\nremove or avoid greenhouse \\ngas (GHG) emissions. These \\ncredits are created when \\nprojects are established to \\nreduce or remove carbon \\nfrom the atmosphere. Those \\nwho own carbon credits are \\ntherefore allowed a certain \\namount of emissions.\\nOsaka Gas developed a system \\nto analyse credit project \\nplans by using generative \\nartificial intelligence (AI). \\nThe system will evaluate \\nconsistency across plans, \\nwith multiple standards to \\ncheck carbon credit quality.\\nMarubeni is currently working \\nboth domestically and \\ninternationally to support \\nand carry out activities that \\nreduce GHG emissions.\\nUnder the agreement, Marubeni \\nwill explore how Osaka Gas’ \\nAI system can undergo \\ndevelopment and expansion.The collaboration aligns \\nwith Japan’s announcement \\nin October 2020 that the \\ncountry plans to achieve \\ncarbon neutrality by 2050.\\nJapan’s Muji brand to use \\nProtego packaging paper \\nfrom South Korea’s Hansol \\nPaper for 11 products\\nHansol Paper’s Protego flexible \\npackaging paper is to be used \\nby Japanese lifestyle brand Muji \\nfor 11 refillable products, such \\nas shampoos, body washes and \\ndetergents, the South Korean \\npaper producer said this week.\\nProtego was developed as a \\nreplacement for traditional \\nflexible packaging materials \\nand introduced to the market \\nin early 2021 as a paper \\nalternative to plastic aluminium, \\naccording to Hansol Paper.Protego is disposable as \\nrecyclable waste and more than \\n90% of it is biodegradable.\\nProtego is treated with a \\nunique coating to insulate it \\nfrom the effect of exposure \\nto oxygen, heat and moisture, \\nthe company said.\\nThe coating is certified by the \\nFood and Drug Administration \\nin the US and Protego has been \\ncertified as a green technology \\nproduct by South Korea’s \\nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and \\nRural Affairs, the company said.\\nProtego was a winner at the \\n2025 Worldstar Global Packaging \\nAwards, winning the President \\nand Bronze awards for its \\nsuitability as food packaging, \\nfor its printability and for \\nintegrated functionalities \\n- including its moisture, \\noxygen and heat barrier.PPI Asia\\n16 | risi.com PPI Asia | November 29, 2024PPI Asia \\nCopyright 2024 by RISI, Inc.

Log exports to India \\ncrashed to a comparatively \\npaltry $28 million in 2021 after \\nthe ban on methyl bromide.\\nThe MPI trialled a possible \\nsolution between September \\n15 and October 31, 2023. \\nInstead of treating logs before \\nsailing out of New Zealand \\nharbours, the MPI allowed logs \\nto be fumigated upon arrival in \\nIndia. According to MPI’s page \\npertaining to Indian exports, \\n“methyl bromide fumigation \\nof breakbulk logs in ship holds \\nmay be undertaken on arrival” .\\nChanges to these fumigation \\npractices were instrumental \\nfor kicking off a revival in the \\nlog market, and shipments \\nbegan to arrive at Indian ports \\nin March and April this year \\nafter the trade drought.\\n“We need to invest in relational \\nand not transactional \\nrelationships,” McClay said in \\nhis November 21 speech.\\n“Already, we are seeing this \\n[approach] work with more \\nengagement at all levels across \\nthe Indian system,” he added.\\nWhile not in a recession, New \\nZealand’s economy has been in a \\nslump, with the latest government \\nstatistics showing that migration \\narrivals are on a downtrend while \\ndepartures are rising. This has \\nmade it even more crucial for \\nthe government to shore up the \\npillars of its economic growth, \\nespecially its primary sector.\\nAccording to the New Zealand \\ngovernment, 80% of its exports \\ncome from the country’s primary \\nsector, with forestry and wood \\nproducts making up the country’s \\nfourth-biggest export earner.\\nJapan producer JPP’s new \\nEuropean subsidiaries \\nto change names by \\nend of November\\nJapan Pulp & Paper will be \\nrenaming its acquisitions of \\nnew Inapa subsidiaries to OVOL \\nComPlott GmbH and OVOL \\nFrance, SAS, the company said in \\na press release on November 20.\\nJPP announced its acquisition \\nof new Inapa subsidiaries in \\nEurope last month: Inapa \\nDeutschland, Inapa ComPlott \\nand Inapa Packaging in Germany \\nalong with Inapa French SAS \\nand JJ LOOS SAS in France.\\nThe Japanese producer then \\nheld a Board of Directors '),\n",
